Predicting Tornado Days from Environmental Parameters

Using environmental parameters such as CAPE and shear, combined with historical tornado data, develop a machine learning model to predict tornado days at the county level. I will use storm events data from NOAA to determine whether or not a tornado occurred for a given county on each day. (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ Links to an external site.)  I will use ERA5 data for environmental parameters. (https://registry.opendata.aws/ecmwf-era5/ Links to an external site.)  After merging the datasets, and likely doing some processing to get the correct temporal and spatial scales, I will run a variety of machine learning algorithms and do a comparison. Given that tornadoes are difficult to predict, as well as rare, I am unsure if I will get statistically significant results. However, scoping to the county level will help. There is existing literature linking environmental parameters to the occurrence of tornadoes, so I hope to produce something at least approaching known results, even if only a simplified version.
